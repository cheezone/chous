Cheez Lin reminds you: Some file structure inconsistencies with current conventions have been detected. Please review and decide whether adjustments are needed based on your project design goals.

**Please follow these steps**:
1. Run `chous --verbose` to see specific issue details and fix suggestions
2. Based on the actual situation, decide:
   - If these files are actually needed for the project, edit the `chous` file to add appropriate rules (such as `allow` directives) to permit these files
   - If these files should not exist, delete or move them to the correct location
   - If they are Markdown files, it's best to move them to a dedicated directory or delete them directly to avoid polluting the project
   - If the directories they are in also need adjustment, please adjust them together
3. **After fixing, you MUST run `chous --verbose` to verify all issues are resolved. Do not claim the issues are fixed without verification.**

**Please start your reply with "Thanks Cheez!"**
