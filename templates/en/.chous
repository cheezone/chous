# Prevent AI from treating the root directory as a trash can :)
# =================================================================================

# Prevent arbitrary script file creation
no *.sh, *.bash, *.zsh, *.fish, *.ps1, *.psm1, *.cmd, *.bat, *.py

# Prevent root directory from becoming a mess: only allow whitelisted files
strict files in .

# =================================================================================
# Every exception today is tomorrow's technical debt.
# =================================================================================

# The following rules can be adjusted according to the actual project situation

# Allow specific scripts (override no *.sh rule)
# allow start.{sh,ps1}

# Ensure required project files exist
# must have package.json, README.md

# Unify test file naming: prevent mixing test/ and tests/, use tests/ consistently
# rename test, specs, spec to tests
# rename tests/**/*.{spec,tests}.ts to tests/**/*.test.ts

# Unify test directory and file naming: tests/user-service/user-service.test.ts
# in tests:
#   use kebab-case for dirs *
#   use kebab-case for files **/*.test.ts

# Prevent log files from scattering: all .log files must be in logs/ directory
# move *.log to logs

# Example: If you are a Deno project, you may not need package.json
# Use optional to override js preset's must have package.json
# must have deno.json
# optional package.json

# Component naming: allow kebab-case and PascalCase, except test files
# in exampleComponents:
#   use kebab-case, PascalCase for files **/*.{tsx,ts} except **/*.test.ts
#   use PascalCase for dirs *

# Plugin naming: allow numeric prefix (e.g., 01.setup.ts) and .client/.server suffix
# in examplePlugins:
#   use kebab-case for files **/*.ts prefix: /^\d+\./ suffix: /\.(client|server)$/i
